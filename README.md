## Project Overview

This application is designed to quickly evaluate the emotional tone (sentiment) of any given text, such as a customer review, social media comment, or product description. Users paste text into the field, and the application instantly returns a Polarity Score and a clear "Positive," "Negative," or "Neutral" label.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases core Python proficiency in building and deploying a complete, interactive application:

* **Live Deployment:** Successfully deployed a pure Python script to **Streamlit Cloud** for global accessibility.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilized the **`TextBlob`** library to perform efficient sentiment analysis (calculating polarity and subjectivity).
* **Dependency Management:** Correctly configured the deployment environment using **`requirements.txt`** to manage external libraries (`streamlit`, `textblob`, `nltk`).
* **User Interface (UI) Development:** Employed the **`streamlit`** library to create a clean, modern, and responsive web interface using text areas, columns, and metric display elements.
* **Data Handling:** Implemented logical flow control to process user input and return structured analytical data.
